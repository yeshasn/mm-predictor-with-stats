# Introduction
March Madness in my opinion is one of the most exhillarating times of the year. 64 teams, 63 games, 1 champion. The concept of the march madness bracket seems easy. Pick a winner for all 63 games, in the hopes of having a 100% accuracy and a shot at millions of dollars. However, this feat has never been done before. The game of basketball has many statistics: shooting percentage, free throw percentage, points per game, and so on. This got me thinking... is there a way to predict the winners of each game by comparing the statistics of two teams and choosing the "statistically better team"?
